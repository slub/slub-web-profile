News uses [semantic versioning][2], which means, that
* **bugfix updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bugfixes or security relevant stuff without breaking changes,
* **minor updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks without breaking changes,
* **major updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes which can be refactorings, features or bugfixes.

### 2.2 Api

#### Configuration

The general domain to call the "profile service" can be set in the field "Domain" in "Settings Module" -> "Extension Configuration". Just take care that the domain begins with a protocol like "https://" and has no trailing slash. The profile service works with different paths to provide a multilingual experience you can configure via typoscript.
